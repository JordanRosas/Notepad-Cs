> This was a side project I took on when learning C#. There was a pretty steep learning curve just becuase there wasn't as much coding as I expected to achieve this result. It was definitely a more UI project than a server side but it was still fun to explore more of what Visual Studio has to offer!

## What did I learn?

- To create web forms in visual studio
- Program specific buttons created in the webform to carry out tasks like an `undo` for example
- UI even when seems simple can be pretty challenging
- Learning a new skill takes time and practice!
